                        Hi! My name is Nithin Rajakumar. 
                        I am a freshman curently attending Dublin High School, in California.
                        When I'm not in school, I like reading Harry Potter and playing League of Legends. 
                        I currently am aspiring to become a website developer when I graduate college. 
                        In order to become a website developer, I'm taking the computer science class at Dublin High, and I'm planning take the Principles of Engineering class as well as the Engineering Academy. 
                        I've always had a passion for coding, and being a website developer is a very intriguing frontier in my perspective. </p>
                        <p>
                         In order to become a successful programmer, you have to be able to communicate with your peers and solve problems by yourself, and be able to solve other people's problems. 
                         I demonstrate these such characteristics of a computer programmer when I figure out my own problems and help other people solve theirs. 
                         In middle school, and the first part of my high school career, I have learned how to manage my time and work. 
                         These skills are needed to be a website developer, because making and maintaining a complex website is lots of work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         So far in my high school career, I have joined the Dublin High Cross Country team and got a job at the Kumon education center. 
                         I've also joined the Boy Scouts of America, and am currently working on my eagle community service project in order to get my Eagle Scout rank.
                         Throughout all of this, I have acquired time management and leadership skills, such as communitcation. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         My skills allow me to adaquetly become a website developer, so please navigate the rest of my website and give me feedback on it's functionality.
                         Thanks you, and have fun!
                        </p>
