                <h4>September 8, 2017</h4>
                <p><strong>Project Objective:</strong>
                <p>
                    Create a game or story where the user must use the keyboard to fundamentally affect what happens.
                </p>
                <p>In my Computer Science course, I had to work with Nick Sacca to create this creative game on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>.
                   We wanted to create an interactive game with a ball getting from point a to point b. 
                   During the project, I coded most of the game, and learned how to use variables to make specific commands activate and deactivate.
                   One particular obstacle that I had trouble coding was the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/81750416/">jumping mechanism</a> used in the game.
                   I solved that problem by using the help from another developer, and then using their idea to solve the problem in my own way. 
                   Throughout the course of the project, my partner and I recorded our progress in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hKPq3KfU6q5jEOcrQ5qHBHfnY1r19tPC_I2ZYVjhfHQ/edit">project notebook</a>.

                <h4>January 24, 2018</h4>
                <p><strong>Project Objective:</strong>
                <p>
                    Create a game similar to hangman where a player has to think of the hidden word, with as minimal mistakes as possible.
                </p>
                <p>In my Computer Science course, I had to work with Aarush Aitha to create a version of hangman using the python language on <a href="https://c9.io">Cloud 9</a> .
                   We wanted to create a game that not only had the hangman requirements, but also a theme, which we chose to be The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. 
                   During the project, I learned how to utilize loops and interations do complete complicated functions.
                   One particular obstacle that I had trouble coding was the commands that would hide the letters of the secret word used in the game.
                   I solved that problem by using the help from another developer, and then using their idea to solve the problem in my own way.
